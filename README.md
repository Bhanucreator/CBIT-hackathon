 Problem Statement 1:”Local Food Marketplace”
 Scenario: Small farmers have limited channels to sell their produce, often relying on middlemen

 local food but struggle to find reliable suppliers. The Challenge: Create a digital platform that
 directly connects local farmers with buyers, eliminating intermediaries and building community
 food networks
